# Define Repo Name

Every project start with the definition of the repo (repository) name:
- This name should embody the scope of the project
- The name must be unique in regard to other repo's already published to NPM:
  - One solution is to define your projects with a prefix (eg. prefix_repoName --> "lamed_flowchart)
  - Another solution is to build a project name from a short sentence like "see_it_done"
