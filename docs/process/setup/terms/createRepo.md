# Create Repo

Create a new repo (repository) on github: 
- Enter the repo_name (see "Define Repo Name")
- Write a short description of the project. 
- Choose the MIT licence and select public setting if it is an open source project. 
- Initialize this repository with a README
- Do not choose a .gitignore (this is done in a later step)
