## Perez Lamed van Niekerk
Perez Lamed van Niekerk was introduced to the Basic language in 1982 on the Apple II personal 
computer at the age of 12 years. From that time he created software solutions whenever possible. 
He lived through the Word Star, dBase III, MS Access, Visual Basic, ASP areas. He lived through 
the OO (object orientation) and XML hype and was excited about what was promised (but never delivered). 
He has worked on Informix, SQL-server, Borland  Delphi projects. Since 2008 his main focus was 
SQL- Server & c# .Net development solving mechanical engineering problems. 

Perez tries to design at 
least one new software solution every week. Of those designs, he implements at least one every 
three months. He really feel sad about the designs he can not implement only because there is 
just not enough time in the day. He created LamedaL project in order one day to be able to create 
a new software solution every two days. When that day arrives, he would also like to share this 
experience with others.The following are a few of his personal quotes:
- "I will buy you a coke if you can can find a bug in my software library."
- "You can rate the quality of your software by the emotion someone displays when a new bug is discovered":
    - The happier the person is - the better your software is. 
    - The madder the person is - the worst your software is. 
    - When someone burst out in tears - your project is in real big trouble.
    - When someone does not care - your project is already dead.
- "The worst thing about a software project is when nobody uses it. The second worst thing is to never receive feedback. Always remember this when people complains about problems in the software." 
- "The one thing that makes real software developers different from other people is that we are not afraid of failure. Bugs and failures are good friends and we love them. We use those failures to create better test cases and as a result better software."

During early 2018 Perez investigated the Node.js platform and JavaScript ecosystem. There was a brilliance 
in the way things were done that really inspired him. He decided in May of 2018 to try his hand on 
WebStorm and started with a few 
Javacript project (listed on [see it done](https://github.com/perezLamed/see_it_done)). 
- The first project was [lamed_learn](https://github.com/perezLamed/lamed_learn) and the 
main goal of the project is to help a person to learn new concepts and to retain that learning. 
This project has had a major impact on his life and is used daily to help him learn and remember new things.
- Many supporting projects were started in order to facilitate the "**see it done**" project. 
See [dashboard](https://github.com/perezLamed/see_it_done/blob/master/README.md).
- In order to easily define processes, Lamed designed a flowchart markdown:
  - [lamed_flowchart](https://github.com/perezLamed/lamed_flowchart) project (Markdown flowcharts). 
  See [samples](https://perezlamed.github.io/lamed_flowchart/).
  - [lamed_floweditor](https://github.com/perezLamed/lamed_floweditor) (Markdown flowchart editor) 
  that he integrated with WebStorm editor.
